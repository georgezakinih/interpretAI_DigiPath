# Building Interpretable AI for Digital Pathology 
Hands-on Sessions at the Building Interpretable AI for Digital Pathology AMLD workshop 2021

Participants will work on the implementation of Class Activation Mapping as an example of  heatmaps of salient input pixels. Regression Concept Vectors will be applied to generate complementary explanations in terms of clinically relevant measures such as nuclei area and appearance. Graph Neural Networks will be explained together with their application to cell graphs, showing how they can directly incorporate a higher level of transparency in terms of entity importance, which can be interpreted by graph-pruning. 


#### Hands-on Session 1
Understanding the decision process on ConvNets with (i) feature and (ii) concept attribution

#### Hands-on session 2
Learning at the biological-entity level: cell graph, graph neural networks & explainability
